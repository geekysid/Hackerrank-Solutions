    Electrical and Instrumentation Engineer by eductaion and Software Engineer by profession. I am a self-taught coder who has worked on languages like, HTML, Javascript, PHP, Asp.net, and Python. After working for years in a couple of IT companies (One of which was India's best IT Company - WIPRO), I took a break off for the IT World for 4 years to take care of Family Business. During these 4 years, I built an ERP with Billing Software for my own company from scratch on the asp.net platform. Now that I have sold my family business, looking to re-start my IT career as a Python Developer.
